# FUR database (FURdb)
The Flanking Unique Region database identifies unique genomic regions flanking annotation entries and allows them to be exported for alignment. The alignment file can then be used to produce expression counts for each annotation. This information can aid in identifying annotations which contain an active promoter.

Supported annotation file formats are: BED, GTF/GFF, DFAM and UCSC Table browser downloads.  

The 'doc' folder contains documentation on the use of FURdb.
